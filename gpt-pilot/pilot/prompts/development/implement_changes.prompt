I need to modify file `{{ file_name }}` that currently looks like this:
```
{{ file_content }}
```
This file needs to be modified by these instructions:
---------------------start_of_instructions------------------------------
{{ code_changes_description }}
----------------------end_of_instructions-----------------------------

I want you to implement the instructions and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.
