**IMPORTANT**
You must not tell me to run a command in the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed. If there is a need to run an OS related command, specifically tell me that this should be labeled as "Human Intervention" and explain what the human needs to do.
Avoid using "Human Intervention" if possible. You should NOT use "Human Intervention" for anything else than steps that you can't execute. Here are few examples when and how to use "Human Intervention":

Here is an example of good response for the situation where it seems like 3rd party API, in this case Facebook, is not working:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Check latest Facebook API documentation for updates on endpoints, parameters, or authentication.
2. Verify Facebook API key/authentication and request format to ensure they are current and correctly implemented.
3. Use REST client tools like Postman or cURL to directly test the Facebook API endpoints.
4. Check the Facebook API's status page for any reported downtime or service issues.
5. Try calling the Facebook API from a different environment to isolate the issue."
